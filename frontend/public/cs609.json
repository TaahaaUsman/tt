Windows offers tools like pipes, shared memory, and sockets to\n        safely share data and signals between processes.\n      </p>\n\n      \n      <h2 class=\"short-notes-topic-heading\" id=\"topic8\">\n        Topic 8: Thread Management & Scheduling\n      </h2>\n      \n\n      <p class=\"short-notes-paragraphs\">\n        A <strong>thread</strong> is the smallest part of a process that can run\n        independently. Threads are useful for doing multiple tasks at the same\n        time inside a single program. Windows lets you create and control\n        threads, and decides which thread runs when — this is called\n        <strong>scheduling</strong>.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3 class=\"short-notes-sub-heading\">What is a Thread?</h3>\n      <ul class=\"short-notes-highlight-list\">\n        <li>It is a part of a process that does some work.</li>\n        <li>All threads of a process share the same memory and data.</li>\n        <li>Threads help make programs faster and more responsive.</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h3 class=\"short-notes-sub-heading\">Creating and Managing Threads:</h3>\n      <ul class=\"short-notes-highlight-list\">\n        <li><code>CreateThread()</code>: Starts a new thread.</li>\n        <li><code>ExitThread()</code>: Stops a thread safely.</li>\n        <li>\n          <code>GetCurrentThread()</code>: Gets info about the current thread.\n        </li>\n        <li><code>Sleep()</code>: Pauses the thread for a set time.</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h3 class=\"short-notes-sub-heading\">Thread Scheduling:</h3>\n      <ul class=\"short-notes-highlight-list\">\n        <li>Windows decides which thread runs next using priorities.</li>\n        <li>Higher priority threads get more CPU time.</li>\n        <li>\n          Threads can be paused and resumed using functions like\n          <code>SuspendThread()</code> and <code>ResumeThread()</code>.\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h3 class=\"short-notes-sub-heading\">Thread Synchronization:</h3>\n      <ul class=\"short-notes-highlight-list\">\n        <li>\n          <strong>WaitForSingleObject():</strong> Waits for a thread or resource\n          to finish or become available.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <strong>WaitForMultipleObjects():</strong> Waits for more than one\n          thread or resource.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          These help avoid conflicts when threads try to access the same\n          resource.\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p class=\"short-notes-paragraphs\">\n        <strong>Summary:</strong> Threads allow a program to do many tasks at\n        once. Windows gives control over creating, pausing, and ending threads.\n        It also schedules them based on importance and keeps things running\n        smoothly and safely.\n      </p>\n\n      \n      <div class=\"short-notes-summary\">\n        <h2>🎯 Short Notes Wrap-Up</h2>\n        <p class=\"short-notes-paragraphs\">\n          Great job! 🎉 You’ve now completed the CS609 short notes.
